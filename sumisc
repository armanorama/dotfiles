### Do not run these commands as-is unless you know what you're doing.
### For this reason I've commented, made unexecutable and removed the commands of the riskier ones.
### This is mainly to serve as a todo for my fresh installs

## Generate locale
# sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8

## Pacman install inotify-tools, for which vim-latex-live-preview (with mupdf) and .scripts/mupdf.inotify depends
# sudo pacman -S inotify-tools

## Port some user envs to root env
# Modify /etc/sudoers: Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* TERM TERMINAL EDITOR VISUAL SHELL"

## Make symbolic links to home .vim and .vimrc to root home
# sudo ln -s $HOME/.vim /root/.vim && sudo ln -s $HOME/.vimrc /root/.vimrc
